An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

## Python's specific IDE

There are many IDEs for Python, but none are perfect, and there is no consensus in the Python community. There is no real "canonical" choice as Rstudio is **the one** for `R` users.

As Python is a real jackknife programming language, depending on your goal (data scientific program, web development, etc.) you may choose a specific IDE for a particular task.

- Scientific computing: [Pyzo](https://pyzo.org/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- Generic: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

We warmly recommend you use an IDE, and we will mostly describe VSCode in what follows.

## VSCode/Codium

For instance, you can use `VSCode`. This is a powerful, cross-platform IDE that comes with many extensions.

On the FdS-Linux box, there is a fork of `VSCode` called `vscodium`.
You may launch it via the GUI or through the following command line

```bash
$ vscodium
```

or

```bash
$ code
```

### Install a VSCode extension

We will install the Python extension.
To install it:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Open the Extensions tab (left bar of the VSCode window or simply press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Type Python to find the Python extension from Microsoft
4. Click the `Install` button, then the `Enable` button

or

1. Open VSCode
2. Press `Ctrl+P` to open the Quick Open dialog
3. Type `ext install ms-python.python` to find the extension
4. Click the `Install` button, then the `Enable` button

or

1. Run in a terminal

```bash
$ vscodium --install-extension ms-python.python
```

## EXERCISE: Installation on your machine
1. Install the Python extension in your VSCode

### An advanced text editor

The `keyboard shortcuts Reference guide` is available in the `help` menu (or with `Ctrl+K Ctrl+R` shortcut).
It can be very useful to learn some shortcuts.
For instance:

- Learn how **multicursors** work (*e.g.,* search for an occurrence with `Ctrl+d`)
- Create aligned **multicursors** with `Ctrl+Shift`
- Learn how to move an entire line with `Alt+up`
- etc.

### Using VSCode as a Python IDE

*Reference:* [VSCode docs for Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

This part is dedicated to setting up `VSCode` to use it as a Python IDE. You should have a working `VSCode` (with Python extension) and `anaconda` program.

##  EXERCISE: VSCode and Python

1. Start VSCode in a project (workspace) folder: Using a command prompt or terminal, create an empty folder called `test_dir`, navigate into it, and open VSCode (`vscodium`) in that folder (`.`) by entering the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mkdir test_dir
    cd hello
    code
    ```
    **Note:** If you're using an Anaconda distribution, be sure to use an Anaconda command prompt.

    By starting VSCode in a folder, that folder becomes your "workspace". VSCode stores settings that are specific to that workspace in the (hidden) subfolder `.vscode/settings.json`, which are separate from user settings that are stored globally.

    Alternatively, you can run VSCode through the operating system UI, then use `File > Open Folder` to open the project folder.

2. Select a Python interpreter: Python is an interpreted language; to run Python code, you must tell VSCode which interpreter to use.

    From within VSCode, select a Python 3 interpreter by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), start typing the `Python: Select Interpreter` command to search, then select the command. You can also use the `Select Python Environment` option on the Status Bar if available

3. Open the terminal in VSCode and download with `wget` or `curl` the file `test_python.py` [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephsalmon/HAX712X/main/Courses/IDE/test_python.py). Run it through the IDE.


4. Next, you have to learn how to debug a simple Python script, see the [VSCode help on debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debuggings) for that.
