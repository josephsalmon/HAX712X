## Tests

Tests are small pieces of code ensuring that a part of a program is working as expected.

### Why tests are useful

This is why we place the uttermost importance on implementing tests **along** the development steps.
It will help you to ensure:

- that code works correctly.
- that changes do not break anything.
- that bugs are not reintroduced.
- robustness to user errors.
- code is reachable (*i.e.*, it will actually be executed)

### Types of tests

There are different kinds of tests:

1. Unit tests: they test whether a function does the right thing.
2. Integration tests: they test whether the system/process does the right thing.
3. Non-regression tests: they test whether a bug got removed (and will not be reintroduced).

### How to test?

Many coding languages come with their own test framework.
In `python`, we will focus on [`pytest`](http://doc.pytest.org).
It is simple though powerful.
`pytest` searches for all `test*.py` files and runs all `test*` methods found.
It outputs a nice error report.

### <font color='red'>Exercise</font>

1. Install `pytest` with `pip` using the user scheme (`--user` option)
2. Test if the command `pytest` is in your PATH (depending on your configuration you will have to add `~/.local/bin` in PATH)

Get the path to `pytest` binary
```python
>>> import pytest
>>> pytest.__path__
/path/to/pytest
```
then, in a terminal
```bash
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/pytest
$ pytest --help
```

### Example

Let us assume we have a file `inc.py` containing

```python
def inc1(x):
    return x + 1

def inc2(x):
    return x + 2
```

Thence, the content of `test_inc.py` is

```python
from inc import inc1, inc2

# This test will work
def test_inc1():
    assert inc1(3) == 4

# This test will fail
def test_inc2():
    assert inc2(-1) == 4
```

To run these tests:

```bash
$ pytest test_inc.py
```

## EXERCISE: documentation


1. Correct the `test_inc2` test.
2. Determine the syntax to run any test in a directory.
3. Determine the syntax to run only the test called `test_inc1`.

## Code coverage

`pytest` comes with some useful [plugins](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/plugins.html). In particular, we will use the coverage report plugin.

A **test coverage** is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs.
A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing: this suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.

To install the coverage plugin simply run

```bash
$ pip install pytest-cov
```

Assuming the `inc_cov.py` contains:

```python
def inc(x):
    if x < 0:
        return 0
    return x + 1

def dec(x):
     return x - 1
```

and a single test is performed through the file `test_inc_cov.py`

```python
from inc_cov import inc

def test_inc():
     assert inc(3) == 4
```

then

```bash
pytest test_inc_cov.py --cov

## EXERCISE:

1. Install the `pytest`'s coverage plugin.
2. Load the `biketrauma` package you can download at <https://github.com/HMMA238-2020/biketrauma/>
3. Add some unit tests to `biketrauma` in a new sub-directory `./biketrauma/tests/`:
    - Create a first `test_df()` that test if the Côtes-d'or département has 459 accidents. And a second `test_df_log()` testing that the log of the number of accidents in the département 92 is close to `7.651120176`.

    - Create a `test_dl()` function that tests the `md5sum` hash of the downloaded file (a.k.a. `bicycle_db.csv`). You may use the `pooch` package or you can use this piece of code to compute the md5sum:
:::

```python
import hashlib
def md5(fname):
    hash_md5 = hashlib.md5()
    with open(fname, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            hash_md5.update(chunk)
    return hash_md5.hexdigest()
```

You should achieve a 92% of code coverage:
